* In which I map out various lines of inquiry that the NEW MBA will explore
" %}

I'm excited to use the NEW MBA to explore a range of questions related to work, working identity and personal agency. Some threads I'm excited to pull on:

* If we take as given that organizations are emergent, not planned, then how does that change the ways we work? I feel like we've acknowledged that organizations are not planned, but I don't think we've really followed that insight to it's conclusion about how we show up every day.
* How do you gain influence, power and authority inside organizations? Especially in a remote-first world.
* If simulations are the best way to teach tacit skills, how do you construct engaging, effective business simulations?
* How do you design executive level education programs that are both effective, and aren't overly time consuming? This is a key tradeoff for busy orgs and busy execs that want to level up.
* How does the quarterly planning cycles of companies need to adapt and change and how do we replace it with something new, better, well documented so that it can actually change behavior?
