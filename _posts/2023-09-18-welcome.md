Hi, I'm Tom. I've spent the last 9 years as an independent consultant. One of the best things about consulting is that you get a peek into so many different work contexts, team structures and working environments.

One thing is common across all of the companies that I've worked with - there is dysfunction. Sometimes more and sometimes less but there's **always** frustration somewhere. People stuck in situations not having the impact they believe they should have.

I think this comes down to some relatively straightforward ideas:

1) Knowledge of business and context for the work theyr
2) Communication and influence skills
3) Personal working styles and 


It's not always functional. What you see a lot of is frustration and burn out. People feeling fed up, lost and angry at the environment they work in. And this isn't just for the younger workers - senior executives are feeling equally lost, directionless and 

Does what I do matter?

There's two ways to answer that question - firstly through a lens of "aligned with my values" - is the company I work for doing what I want to see in the world? Then there's a more pragmatic, immediate concern - am I having 

Everyone is questing for impact. Can I believe that what I'm working on has an impact on the world around me? Am what I 

That's why I'm launching the NEW MBA. I've spent the last 2.5 years building and refining the SEO MBA - a course curriculum to teach executive presence to SEO professionals. The open secret is that the course doesn't teach 

## Ok, but what is the NEW MBA exactly?

The NEW MBA is primarily an education platform - designed to help mid-career and senior leaders become more confident and capable. To learn how to have an impact, to give a greater sense of personal agency in a world of confusing context and ugly leadership practices.

There are four main themes I'm excited to explore:

### 1. Seeing like an executive

### 2. Learning influence

### 3. Networked Careers

### 4. How Technology Changes Work

So, who is the NEW MBA for?

* Consultants and anyone with "strategy" in their job title

## Courses & Consulting

Watch this space and join the newsletter for news about upcoming courses and cohorts. The first course will be the executive presence course I've been refining for the last 2.5 years. 

I'm still consulting, partly because I love it and partly because I think it keeps me sharp. I want the writing to come from a place of expertise and personal observation - not simply re-formulating content from others to cover the same topics in dry ways. Hopefully this will keep me fueled with observation and insight for years to come.

## What's Next?

Ok, there's also a library of some of my favorite resources for thinking about impact, influence, strategy, careers and more. Check it out for a vibe check for the kinds of things I want to write about.




Early in our careers we tend to care about being competent. You focus on learning the skills you need to get the work done in front of you. Things like how to build design systems, or how to 

Stage 1: Learning the work in front of you
Stage 2: Getting buy-in for the work
Stage 3: Understanding the whole system

The transitions are the hardest. They lead to the most turbulence for us personally. 

The world of work is complex, collaborative andâ€¦ changing. To have an impact in this environment we need to learn how to see the world of work in new ways.
