A while ago I tweeted this, mostly as a kind of hype post to friends writing online:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What a golden age for new independent, alternative, interesting business writing and blogging.<br><br>Some faves:</p>&mdash; Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1572321104718331906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 20, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But gradually I've really come to believe it. What a golden age for independent, business writing!

The vibe is:

Deep, but accessible, research-backed writing like Cedric's writing on [Business Expertise](https://commoncog.com/expertise/).

Thoughtful, nuanced, first-hand wisdom at senior levels like Mandy writing on [Consenting to Decisions](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/consenting-to-decisions/)

Modern, insightful perspectives with strong opinions like Behzod's presentation on [Building a Research Team may cost you your Research Practice](https://www.dropbox.com/s/caw2g88xc3mc539/User%20Research%20London%20Keynote%20-%20Public%20with%20Speaking%20Notes.pdf?dl=0)

Not to mention things like Reforge Artifacts, Stratechery, First Round Review and more. There's so much good stuff out there. I want to read it and I want to organize and make sense of it.

So the NEW MBA is launching with a [library](https://newmba.co/library/). It's small and not that impressive for now but there are big ideas behind it including full-text search and more. Stay tuned.

And if you have some favorite business-writing that you want to see included there shoot me a note!
