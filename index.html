        Everyone aspires to have an impact with their work, and so everyone quests for skills. A set of skills that make you capable.
        <br><br>
But being capable with a set of skills doesn’t explain the full picture - at some point in our careers we realize that doing the work isn’t enough, we also need to learn how to do the work around the work.
<br><br>
What is the work around the work? Well every business and every project exists in a set of overlapping contexts - markets, resources, people, operations.
<br><br>
Learning how to see these contexts, and doing your work in relation to these contexts is what we call “being strategic”. It’s that simple.
