        The world of work is complex, collaborative and… changing. To have an impact in this environment we need to learn how to see the world of work in new ways.
      <br><br>
        Every business and every project exists in overlapping circles of contexts: the markets we operate in, the ways work gets done, the economic environment and the people around us. 
        <br><br>
        How we react to work across these contexts reflects how successful we are and how much impact we can have. 
        In order to truly make a difference, we need to do more than the work in front of us, we need to learn how to do <span class="newmba-green b">the work around the work</span>.

The NEW MBA is an exploration of what it takes to be effective in the modern world of work. We’ll learn how to see work from new angles, see projects in a new light and learn the art of effectiveness, influence, and strategic thinking.
<br><br>  
After all, your career depends on it. This isn’t just “being strategic” or "managing up" (though those are both important) - it's your work taking its rightful place within the larger context.
<br><br>
It’s about building careers that have agency and potential. It’s about interesting work. It’s about working better in the contexts around us and with the people around us. It’s heads-up work.
<br><br>
This is the next decade of my career. I'm a weirdo that actually enjoys thinking about and exploring the context of our work and how to have more influence on the world around us and I want to help you build a more resilient, rewarding and remarkable career. The NEW MBA is a platform to do just that. And it launches in September.
<br><br>
Join me and turn your curiosity into a career advantage.
