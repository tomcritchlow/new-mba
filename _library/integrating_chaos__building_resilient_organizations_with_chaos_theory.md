description: "Chaos Theory says that organizations are 'complex adaptive systems' and that through this lens, we can build emergent, adaptive and resilient organizations."
insights:
 - "the 'amount of procedures, vertical layers, interface structures, coordination bodies, and decision approvals within organizations had increased by anywhere from 50% to 350% over a 15-year period.' And in the top 20% most complicated organizations?  The managers in those organizations 'spend 40% of their time writing reports and 30% to 60% of it in coordination meetings.'"
