 - "Classic Competitive Strategy theory assumes that advantage comes from operational superiority—that is, practices, processes, technologies and positioning that result in lower unit costs and/or superior product qualities. Attractive investment opportunities arise from these operating advantages. Cost or product quality advantages are the means to achieve competitive advantage. That implies, though, that the strategic horizon around such prescription is open ended; the opportunities are generic

Such conventional strategy theory does not sufficiently acknowledge the constraints impacting opportunity capture. In reality, firms’ business opportunities and associated growth are typically restricted to a relatively small set of possibilities. Some are controlled already by competitors and others by players that cannot be easily influenced (such as foreign governments).

Crucially, the available possibilities are often transient and also available to competitors. In these situations, operating factors may be far from decisive. Controlling parties, such as governments, are often more concerned with financing issues, capital project execution, and government revenue. Superior financing capacity then becomes an advantage in convincing controlling parties to award opportunities.

Standard strategy theory also says nothing about how capital market conditions change the strategic landscape. Implicitly, strategy theory adopts the ‘self-financing’ assumption of financial theory and ignores how superior financial flexibility allows some competitors to seize the best available prospects while others are immobilized."
