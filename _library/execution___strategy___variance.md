description: "A framework to help prioritize the many ideas that bounce around startups every day."
insights:
 - "Ultimately the real point isn’t that execution is more important than strategy, but rather that they’re complimentary. Strong execution lets you test and validate bits of strategy before they become company-changing decisions. As you’re moving through life as a startup, there are tons of strategic questions to answer, and in my experience trying to figure those out from the bottom-up instead of top-down is a much more powerful approach. In the end, these layers help provide a simple guide as we’re making prioritization decisions that will ultimately shape the product and company’s future."
